# Why I made this

I wanted to make use of old computers as either a Network-Attached Storage (NAS) or a server that can accept input script, perform process, and return output result. I want my old PC to work inside my network and to serve as a backup device that can synchronize with directories in my PC or in PCs connected to the network. In other words, I just want to reuse my old computer/s for backup and support with my current computer/s.
